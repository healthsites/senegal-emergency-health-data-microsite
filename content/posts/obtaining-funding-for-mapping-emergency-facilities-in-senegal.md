Earlier in 2020 HOTOSM announced their Microgrant Call. We jumped at the opportunity to bring various members of our extended community together to submit a proposal.

We recently received the terrific news that [our project is funded](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/second-round-of-rapid-response-micrograntees-announced/)!!

Our project will run from 13 July - 12 August, 2020.
